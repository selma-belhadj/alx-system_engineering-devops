# Loops, conditions and parsing
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of system engineering and devOps pertaining to loops, conditions, and parsing.

### Description of what each file shows:

- Files that start with:
1. public key for SSH RSA key pair (for future use)
2. print using for loop
3. print using while loop
4. print using until loop
5. using while loop; if 9th line print 'Hi'
6. using while loop; if 4th line print a, else 8th line print b
7. using while loop; print according to case
8. using while loop; print hours and minutes
9. for contents in current directory, print names cutting initial field
10. display info about a file: exists? empty? regular file?
