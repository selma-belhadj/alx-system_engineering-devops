# Loops, conditions and parsing
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of system engineering and devOps pertaining to processes and signals: `ps`, `pgrep`, `kill`, `pkill`, `SIGINT` (Ctrl-C), SIGTERM(`kill`), `SIGQUIT`(Ctrl-|)

### Description of what each file shows:

- Files that start with:
1. display bash script's pid
2. list processes
3. display pid's related to bash using ps
4. display pid's related to bash using pgrep
5. create infinite loop with sleep 2 that Ctrl-C can kill
6. script to kill file 4 in different terminal
7. script to pkill file 4 in different terminal
8. upgrade file 4 to catch Ctrl-C SIGINT and display message instead .67 script to kill file 7 in different terminal and gets caught
9. script to pkill file 7 successfully
   -  infinite loop that can be killed with Ctrl-C
   -  infinite loop with multiple signal catches and ultimately exits
   -  creates 5 zombie processes

### Built with
* CLI
* Bash scripts
* OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Executable: chmod +x [filename]; run with ./[filename]
* Style guidelines: [Shellscript for Bash](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck)
